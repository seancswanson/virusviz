While I'm cooped up at home waiting out this COVID-19 outbreak in Seattle, I figured the time would be best utilized to study web development.

I wanted to practice setting up a project, requesting data from an external source, and then manipulating that data to show something meaningful.

In this instance, I will be creating an interactive map that uses geospatial data from WHO and CDC data sets.
